=========

Welcome to `visions`, a system for extendable, performant data types in Python.

    *And you could define your own types, and that's where I got very interested.*
    (..)
    *For me the key idea was that I could basically get my own types.*

    *I can get better types and more flexible types and more efficient types.*
    *It's still the fundamental idea when I want to write a program, I want to write it with my types*
    *that is appropriate to my problem and under the constraints I'm under with hardware, software, environment etc.*
    *and that's the key idea.*

    -- Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++
