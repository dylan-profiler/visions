Visions
=========

Welcome to `visions`, a system for extendable, performant data types in Python.

    And you could define your own types, and that's where I got very interested.
    (..)
    For me the key idea was that I could basically get my own types.

    [In] C++, where I can get better types and more flexible types and more efficient types.
    Its still the fundamental idea when I want to write a program, I want to write it with my types
    that is appropriate to my problem and under the constraints I'm under with hardware, software, environment etc.
    and that's the key idea

    -- Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++
