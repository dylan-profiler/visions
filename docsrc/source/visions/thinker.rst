Types and typesets are poly interpretable.
We provide four ways of viewing these concepts.

The **data type view** focuses on logical and physical data types.

The **subset view** zooms in on viewing types as a subset of all possible values.

The **graph view** gives overview in the relation between types in a typeset.

The **analytics view** directs our attention to subsequent analytical tasks given a typeset.
