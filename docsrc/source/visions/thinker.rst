We find that viewing the concepts of `visions` in a single way is not exhaustive for understanding.
We provide six ways of viewing these concepts.
Note that these views are not mutually exclusive or exhaustive.

- The **goals overview** outlines the axioms driving decisions in `visions`.
- The **data type view** focuses on logical and physical data types.
- The **graph view** gives overview in the relation between types in a typeset.
- The **nested set view** zooms in on viewing types as a subset of all possible values.
- The **application view** directs our attention to subsequent tasks given a typeset.
- The **engineering view** provides reference on performance.
