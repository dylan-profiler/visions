Community contributions
***********************

Contributions are welcome to the `visions` package! Please insure all contributions
abide by the guidelines outlined below.

    *When you build a tool, you do not know how it is going to be used.*
    *You try to improve the tool by looking how it is being used, and how people cut their fingers and stop that from happening.*

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

To get access to the development tools, you should have all dependencies installed.

.. code-block:: console

   pip install visions[dev,test,plotting]

Testing
-------

Test `visions` with ``pytest``:


.. code-block:: console

   make test

Which is equivalent to

.. code-block:: console

   pytest --mypy --black tests/


Linting
-------

`visions` uses the `black` code style.

.. code-block:: console

   make lint

Which is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: console

   black .

Docs
----

The documentation needs to be generated after each contribution, because the API reference is automatically generated.
You can do this by:

.. code-block:: console

   make docs

This builds the docs using sphinx.

You can view the docs locally by going to the `docs/` folder and starting a web server, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

   cd docs/
   python -m http.server


All together
------------

A shorthand for all commands above is:

.. code-block:: console

   make all
