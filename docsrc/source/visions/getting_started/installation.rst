Installation
============

You can install `visions` from source and from pip

Pip
---

Installing with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install visions[all]


By default, `visions` installs the complete set of dependencies, including for specialized types such as images and geodata.
This is great for experimenting, however once you have settled on a set of types, it is recommended to slim down the dependencies.
It is possible to obtain a more lightweight installation by installing only the specific dependencies you really need:

* `type_geometry` for `Geometry`
* `type_image_path` for `Image`

.. code-block:: console

    # Minimal example: only install the default types
    pip install visions

    # Default and geometry dependencies
    pip install visions[type_geometry]

    # Multiple dependency sets
    pip install visions[type_geometry,type_image_path]

For additional dependencies (plotting, development, testing), please read the `contribution page <../creator/contributing>`_.
