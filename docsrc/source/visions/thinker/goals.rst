    Efficiency and reliability

    -- Bjarne Stroustrup


    When you build a tool, you do not know how it is going to be used.
    You try to improve the tool by looking how it is being used, and how people cut their fingers and stop that from happening.

    -- Bjarne Stroustrup

Axioms when designing `visions`:

- Performant: Efficiency as an enabler to more important things (reliability, dependability)
- Simplify expressing data types -> sensible defaults
- New types composable from other elements
- Types representative of analysis, fix problems with No, Pd, Py.


    You get the best efficiency out of the best abstraction.

    My main tool for efficiency and performance acutally is abstraction
