Goals
=====

Axioms when designing `visions`:

- **Performant:** Efficiency as an enabler to more important things (reliability, dependability)
- **Saving time:** Simplify expressing data types -> sensible defaults
- **Extendable:** New types are composable from other elements
- **Better:** Types representative of analysis, fix problems with No, Pd, Py.


You get the best efficiency out of the best abstraction.

My main tool for efficiency and performance actually is abstraction

Efficiency and reliability

-- Bjarne Stroustrup

When you build a tool, you do not know how it is going to be used.
You try to improve the tool by looking how it is being used, and how people cut their fingers and stop that from happening.

-- Bjarne Stroustrup
