One of the assumptions in this package is that is extendable.
Extensions can be specific to your use case, or general for the community.

There are myriad ways to extend:

- Create a new data type (example: `email_address`)
- Create a new type set
- Create relations between data types (a field with the strings "J" and "N", might be Dutch or German representations of a boolean)

This section documents basic steps for contributing (e.g. testing and linting) and specific instructions on how to create each of the steps above.
